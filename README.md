# Tic-Tac-Toe

Functioning Tic Tac Toe game board.

One of my most struggled on projects and the most rewarding. Several times I fully started my lessons over again to figure out why my code was not working. Figuring out my learning process was a constaint. I enjoyed the challenges from getting my media sounds to link all the way to missing one # in my code. I am proud of myself for not giving up on this project.
